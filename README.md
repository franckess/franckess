### Hi, I'm Rene 👋

I'm a Mathematician/Statistician by training and Machine Learning Practitioner passionate about making Maths and Statistics more intuitive for newbies in the Data Science field users and seasoned experts alike. I also enjoy working on products that connect people or free up time for the things that truly matter. I like mentoring folks of all ages and backgrounds transitioning to the technology industry.

In terms of technology I mostly work with `R`, `Python`, `Docker` and a variety of cloud services (mostly Microsoft Azure)
